# Flight-Cancellation-Prediction
Flight Cancellation Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict flight cancellations using aviation data, addressing real-world challenges in the aviation industry. The model leverages a Random Forest classifier to analyze features like departure time, airline, and weather conditions, predicting whether a flight will be canceled. The project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model training, evaluation, and visualization, making it a strong portfolio piece for an Artificial Intelligence Development Specialist role.
Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
Class Imbalance: Uses SMOTE to balance the dataset for accurate predictions.
Model: Trains a Random Forest classifier for robust performance.
Evaluation: Generates a classification report and confusion matrix for model assessment.
Visualization: Includes feature importance and confusion matrix plots for insights.
Deployment: Saves the model and scaler for potential integration into production systems.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
Scikit-learn: For model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
SMOTE (imblearn): To address class imbalance.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualization of results.
Joblib: For model persistence.

Dataset
The model uses aviation data (e.g., from FAA/BTS Airline On-Time Performance Data) with features such as:

Departure time
Airline
Origin and destination airports
Weather conditions (temperature, wind speed)
Cancellation status (0 for on-time, 1 for canceled)

Note: Replace flight_data.csv with your dataset. A synthetic dataset can be created if real data is unavailable.
Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flight-Cancellation-Prediction.git
cd Flight-Cancellation-Prediction


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure flight_data.csv is in the project directory.

Usage

Run the script:python flight_cancellation_model.py


Outputs:
Classification Report: Printed to console with precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion Matrix: Saved as confusion_matrix.png.
Feature Importance Plot: Saved as feature_importance.png.
Model Files: Saved as flight_cancellation_model.pkl and scaler.pkl.

Results

Model Performance: The Random Forest classifier achieves balanced performance on the test set, with detailed metrics in the classification report.
Key Features: Weather conditions and departure time are among the top predictors of cancellations.
Visualizations:
Confusion Matrix: Shows true positives/negatives and errors.
Feature Importance: Highlights the most influential features.



Future Improvements

Integrate real-time weather APIs for dynamic predictions.
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) for improved accuracy.
Add cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
